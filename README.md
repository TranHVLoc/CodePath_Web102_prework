## Notes

The biggest challenge while building the app is using `for loop` to display the game card when I tried to use `for-each` loop initially but it didn't work. So I switched to use `for` loop instead using the index and it finally worked. Luckily `index.js` has been filled with comments so I can follow the instruction easily without much effort to solve the problem. Another challenge is pushing the work on GitHub as I was hindered from submitting by an *authentification* problem as it required me to enter my username and password. After a while doing the research I finally made it to publicing the files on GitHub.
